# Hospital Management System

A Java-based desktop application for managing patient records using Linked List data structure with a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Project Overview
This project allows hospitals or clinics to manage patient records efficiently. Users can add, update, delete, search, and display patient details. Each patient record consists of:

- Patient ID
- Name
- Age
- Disease
- Assigned Doctor

The system uses a Linked List to store patient data dynamically and Java Swing to create an interactive GUI.

## Features
- Add new patient records  
- Update or delete existing patient details  
- Search patients by name or ID  
- Display all patient records in a JTable  
- Dynamic updates using Linked List  

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** NetBeans  
- **Data Structure:** Linked List  
- **GUI:** Java Swing  

## How It Works
- **Add Patient:** Inserts a new node in the linked list with patient details.  
- **Update Patient:** Finds a patient by ID and updates their information.  
- **Delete Patient:** Removes a patient node from the linked list using their ID.  
- **Search Patient:** Searches the linked list by name or ID.  
- **Display All Patients:** Shows all records dynamically in a JTable.  

## User Interface
- Attractive background image  
- Styled labels and buttons  
- Central JTable for patient records  
- Easy-to-use input fields and action buttons
